# Project: Recipes

Hey all. This project is my first step into the web development world, and I am excited to go on this fun (and albeit excruciating) journey!

You might be familiar with The Odin Project. It is a free open-source curriculum that aims to teach the fundamentals to aspiring web developers like myself. This is the first project that they've provided, a simple recipe website that hones in on your HTML basics.

All instructions in the project were followed to the letter. No CSS, just HTML. Although not mentioned in the instructions, I decided to create a directory named images to store the images for the recipes.

Learned a lot with this one! Hoping to learn how to write a better README along the way!
